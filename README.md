It's important to say that it is just a prototype, the idea is to check your ability to propose improvements, features and contribute to the product UI 😄. Feel free to make improvements like new functionalities, animations, visual optimizations, etc.

The logo is the same as the one on the repository.

You **should** develop:

- Filter by state;
- Search by name and/or last name;
- Pagination to navigate between cards;
- Navigation when clicking on customer cards;
- An **internal page** with more details of customers (use your creativity);
- We'll be happy (😍) **if you develop tests** for it.
