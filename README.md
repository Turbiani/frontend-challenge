## The Challenge

### About the layout

The [following Figma layout needs to be developed](https://www.figma.com/proto/0B9mlosIemM9mUlDiTXVIw/Teste-Front-end-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=2-7938&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=2%3A7925&hide-ui=1).

The logo is the same as the one in the repository.

It's important to say that it is just a prototype! We would also like to see your ability to propose improvements, features and new contributions to the product's UI 😄!

**Feel completely free** to make improvements such as:

- etc

You also can add new filters if you want 😋
